# Hackathon PPT Submit Website

This Hackathon PPT Submission Website enables participants to submit their Round 1 PPT along with their Name, Email, Team Name, and Mobile Number. The uploaded PPTs are securely stored in an admin's Google Drive, with the drive link recorded in a MongoDB database. Admins can access and manage all submissions, convert the stored data into an Excel sheet, and easily filter and shortlist teams for the next round. Additionally, the platform provides an option to send email notifications to shortlisted teams, inviting them to proceed further in the hackathon.
